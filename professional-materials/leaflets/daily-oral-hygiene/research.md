## Key Research Findings:

### Brushing Technique:
- Brush teeth twice daily for 2 minutes
- Use fluoride toothpaste (1,350-1,500ppm for adults)
- Don't rinse after brushing - spit don't rinse
- Replace toothbrush every 3 months or when bristles fray
- Use small circular movements
- 45-degree angle to gum line

### Interdental Cleaning:
- Use dental floss or interdental brushes daily
- Clean between teeth before brushing
- If gums bleed initially, this should stop with regular cleaning

### Mouthwash:
- Use at a different time to brushing
- Don't use immediately after brushing as it washes away fluoride
- Choose alcohol-free options where possible

### Diet Advice:
- Limit sugary foods and drinks to mealtimes
- Wait at least 1 hour after eating before brushing
- Drink water or milk between meals
- Avoid snacking between meals

### Additional Care:
- Visit dentist regularly (as advised by your dentist)
- Don't smoke - increases risk of gum disease and oral cancer
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Chew sugar-free gum after meals to stimulate saliva

### Special Considerations:
- Electric toothbrushes can be more effective
- People with limited mobility may benefit from adapted toothbrushes
- Denture wearers need specific cleaning routines

## 2025 Updates:
- Emphasis on "spit don't rinse" message
- Updated fluoride recommendations
- Integration with overall health messaging
- Environmental considerations (bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
