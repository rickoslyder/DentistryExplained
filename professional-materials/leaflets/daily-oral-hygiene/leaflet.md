## Your Daily Routine

### ü™• Brushing Your Teeth

**When to brush:**
- ‚úì Last thing at night before bed
- ‚úì At least one other time during the day
- ‚úì Wait at least 1 hour after eating

**How to brush:**
1. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
2. Apply a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste (1,350-1,500ppm)
3. Hold brush at 45¬∞ angle to your gums
4. Use small circular movements
5. Brush for 2 minutes
6. Clean all surfaces: outer, inner, and chewing surfaces
7. Gently brush your tongue

**Remember: SPIT, DON'T RINSE!**
After brushing, spit out excess toothpaste but don't rinse. This allows the fluoride to continue protecting your teeth.

### ü¶∑ Cleaning Between Your Teeth

**Daily interdental cleaning is essential!**

Choose one of these methods:
- **Dental floss**: Gently guide between teeth using a rubbing motion
- **Interdental brushes**: Choose the right size for each gap
- **Water flossers**: Good alternative if you struggle with traditional methods

**Tip:** Clean between teeth BEFORE brushing to allow fluoride toothpaste to reach these areas.
