## Date: July 2025

## Sources Consulted:
1. NHS - Diet and teeth guidance
2. Action on Sugar - UK sugar consumption data
3. British Dental Association - Diet advice
4. Public Health England - Sugar reduction programme
5. Oral Health Foundation - Diet and oral health

## Key Research Findings:

### Sugar and Tooth Decay:
- Main cause of tooth decay is sugar in food/drinks
- Each sugar exposure = up to 1 hour acid attack
- Frequency more important than amount
- Hidden sugars major problem

### Current UK Statistics:
- Average UK adult consumes 2-3x recommended sugar
- Children consume equivalent of 8 extra sugar cubes daily
- Sugary drinks largest single source
- 170,000 tooth extractions in children annually

### How Sugar Causes Decay:
1. Bacteria feed on sugar
2. Produce acid as waste
3. Acid dissolves tooth enamel
4. Repeated attacks cause cavities
5. Process takes 20-60 minutes per exposure

### Hidden Sugar Sources:
- Breakfast cereals (up to 37% sugar)
- Flavoured yogurts
- Fruit juices (even 100% juice)
- Smoothies
- Cereal bars
- Pasta sauces
- Salad dressings
- "Low fat" products often high sugar

### Safe Snacks:
- Plain yogurt
- Cheese
- Raw vegetables
- Nuts (age appropriate)
- Oatcakes
- Plain popcorn
- Whole fruit (limited)

### Drinks:
Safe: Water, plain milk
Limited: Tea/coffee without sugar
Avoid: Fizzy drinks, squash, juice, energy drinks

### Timing Matters:
- Limit sugar to mealtimes
- 3-4 sugar exposures max per day
- No grazing throughout day
- Nothing but water after evening brushing

### Special Considerations:
- Natural sugars (fruit) still cause decay
- "No added sugar" doesn't mean sugar-free
- Sugar-free products may be acidic
- Dried fruit particularly damaging

### Tips for Reducing Sugar:
- Read labels (4g = 1 teaspoon)
- Gradual reduction works best
- Water as default drink
- Whole fruit over juice
- Plain versions of foods
