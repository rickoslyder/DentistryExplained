## 🍬 The Sugar-Tooth Decay Connection

Every time you eat or drink something sugary, your teeth are under acid attack for up to **ONE HOUR**.

### How it works:
```
Sugar + Bacteria = ACID
         ↓
    Acid Attack (20-60 mins)
         ↓
    Weakened Enamel
         ↓
    TOOTH DECAY
```

**It's not how MUCH sugar - it's how OFTEN!**

## ⏰ The Acid Attack Timeline

### One Day, Two Scenarios:

**Scenario A: All-Day Snacker**
```
7am:  Breakfast + juice        = 1 hour acid ⚠️
9am:  Coffee with sugar        = 1 hour acid ⚠️
11am: Biscuit                  = 1 hour acid ⚠️
1pm:  Lunch + fizzy drink      = 1 hour acid ⚠️
3pm:  Chocolate bar            = 1 hour acid ⚠️
5pm:  Energy drink             = 1 hour acid ⚠️
7pm:  Dinner + dessert         = 1 hour acid ⚠️
9pm:  Evening snack            = 1 hour acid ⚠️

Total: 8 HOURS of acid attack! 🚨
```

**Scenario B: Meal-Time Only**
```
7am:  Breakfast + water        = 1 hour acid ✓
1pm:  Lunch + water            = 1 hour acid ✓
6pm:  Dinner + dessert         = 1 hour acid ✓

```

## 🥤 Drinks: The Hidden Danger

### Sugar Content Shocking Facts:
