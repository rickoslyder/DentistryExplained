# Understanding Tooth Decay - Research Document

## Date: July 2025

## Sources Consulted:
1. NHS - Tooth Decay information
2. Public Health England - Oral health statistics 2025
3. British Dental Association - Caries prevention guidelines
4. NICE Guidelines - Dental decay prevention
5. Action on Sugar - UK dental statistics

## Key Research Findings:

### Current Statistics (2025):
- Over 20% of 5-year-olds have tooth decay
- Tooth decay is #1 reason for hospital admission in 5-9 year-olds
- 23,000 children under 10 admitted to hospital for tooth extraction annually
- Costs NHS over Â£50 million per year
- Entirely preventable condition

### What is Tooth Decay:
- Also called dental caries or cavities
- Caused by acid-producing bacteria
- Damages tooth structure
- Progressive without intervention
- Can affect any age

### The Decay Process:
1. Bacteria + Sugar = Acid
2. Acid attacks tooth enamel
3. Repeated attacks weaken enamel
4. Cavity forms
5. Spreads to inner tooth layers
6. Can reach nerve causing pain

### Risk Factors:
- Poor oral hygiene
- High sugar diet
- Frequent snacking
- Dry mouth
- Lack of fluoride
- Not visiting dentist regularly
- Medical conditions (diabetes, eating disorders)
- Medications reducing saliva

### Signs and Symptoms:
Early:
- White spots on teeth
- Sensitivity to sweet foods
- Mild discomfort

Advanced:
- Visible holes/pits
- Brown/black staining
- Pain when eating/drinking
- Spontaneous toothache
- Bad breath
- Swelling

### Prevention:
- Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste
- Spit don't rinse
- Reduce sugar frequency
- Regular dental visits
- Fluoride varnish (especially children)
- Dental sealants
- Sugar-free gum after meals

### Treatment Options:
- Fluoride treatment (early stages)
- Fillings
- Crowns
- Root canal treatment
- Extraction (last resort)

### Special Considerations:
- Baby bottle tooth decay
- Hidden sugars in foods
- Acid erosion vs decay
- Role of saliva in protection
