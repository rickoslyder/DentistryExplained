## 🦷 What is Tooth Decay?

Tooth decay (dental caries) is damage to your teeth caused by acid-producing bacteria. It's one of the most common health problems worldwide, but it's **completely preventable**.

### The facts:
- 📊 Over 20% of 5-year-olds have tooth decay
- 🏥 #1 reason children aged 5-9 are admitted to hospital
- 💷 Costs the NHS over £50 million annually
- ✅ 100% preventable with good care

## 🔬 How Tooth Decay Happens

### The decay process:

```
Bacteria + Sugar → ACID → Attacks Teeth → CAVITY
```

1. **Bacteria** in your mouth feed on sugars
2. **Acid** is produced as waste
3. **Enamel** (tooth surface) is attacked
4. **Repeated attacks** weaken the tooth
5. **Cavity** (hole) forms
6. **Spreads** deeper without treatment

### Each acid attack lasts up to 1 hour!

---

## ⚠️ Warning Signs

### Early Stage (Reversible):
- ⚪ White spots on teeth
- 😬 Sensitivity to sweet foods
- 🦷 Rough tooth surface

### Advanced Stage (Needs Treatment):
- 🕳️ Visible holes or pits
- 🟫 Brown or black spots
- 😰 Pain when eating/drinking
- 🌙 Toothache at night
- 😷 Bad breath
- 🔴 Swollen gums

**Don't wait for pain! Early decay often has no symptoms.**

## 🛡️ Preventing Tooth Decay

### Daily Care:
✅ **Brush twice daily** - 2 minutes with fluoride toothpaste  
✅ **Spit, don't rinse** - keeps fluoride working  
✅ **Clean between teeth** - floss or interdental brushes  
✅ **Reduce sugar frequency** - limit to mealtimes  

### Professional Care:
✅ **Regular check-ups** - catch problems early  
✅ **Fluoride varnish** - extra protection  
✅ **Fissure sealants** - protects back teeth  
✅ **Diet advice** - personalised tips

## 🍭 The Sugar Connection

### Hidden sugars cause decay too!

**Obviously sugary:**
- Sweets, chocolate, cakes
- Fizzy drinks, squash
- Biscuits, ice cream

**Hidden sugars in:**
- Breakfast cereals
- Flavoured yogurts
- Fruit juices
- Sauces and dressings
- "Healthy" snack bars

### Remember:
- It's not just amount - it's **frequency**
- Each sugar attack = 1 hour of acid
- 5 snacks = 5 hours of acid attack!
