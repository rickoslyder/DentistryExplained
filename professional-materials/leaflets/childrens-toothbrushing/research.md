## Key Research Findings:

### Age-Specific Guidelines:

#### 0-3 Years:
- Start brushing as soon as first tooth appears (around 6 months)
- Use smear of toothpaste
- Minimum 1,000ppm fluoride (unless dentist advises 1,350-1,500ppm)
- Parent/carer must brush teeth
- Twice daily brushing

#### 3-6 Years:
- Pea-sized amount of toothpaste
- Minimum 1,000ppm fluoride (unless dentist advises 1,350-1,500ppm)
- Parent/carer should brush or closely supervise
- Begin teaching child to spit, not rinse

#### 7+ Years:
- Use 1,350-1,500ppm fluoride toothpaste
- Children can brush own teeth but supervise until confident
- Usually independent by age 8
- Continue twice daily routine

### 2025 Updates:

#### Supervised Toothbrushing Programme:
- £11 million government investment
- Targeting 3-5 year-olds in schools/nurseries
- Evidence shows £1 spent saves £3 in treatment costs
- Reduces school absence by 2,666 days per 5,000 children

#### Current Statistics:
- Over 20% of 5-year-olds have tooth decay
- Tooth decay is #1 reason for hospital admission in 5-9 year-olds
- Preventable with good oral hygiene

### Key Messages:
- Never leave young children alone with toothbrush/toothpaste
- Make brushing fun - songs, timers, reward charts
- Lead by example
- Register with dentist by age 1
- Fluoride varnish available from age 3

### Diet Advice:
- Breast milk or formula only in bottles
- No juice in bottles
- Limit sugary foods to mealtimes
- Water or milk between meals
- No food/drink after evening brushing

### Special Considerations:
- Children with additional needs may require adapted brushes
- Some children may need prescription high-fluoride toothpaste
- Disclosing tablets can help show missed areas
