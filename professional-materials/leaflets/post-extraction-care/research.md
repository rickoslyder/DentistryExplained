## Key Research Findings:

### First 24 Hours - Critical Period:
- NO rinsing, spitting, or touching the area
- Blood clot formation is crucial for healing
- Local anaesthetic wears off in 2-6 hours
- No hot food/drinks while numb
- No eating for 3 hours post-extraction

### After 24 Hours:
- Begin warm salt water rinses
- 2 teaspoons salt in large cup warm water
- Rinse gently 3-4 times daily
- Continue for 7 days
- Can resume gentle tooth brushing

### Pain Management:
- Peak pain usually first 2-3 days
- Paracetamol and/or ibuprofen as directed
- Follow dosage instructions carefully
- Avoid aspirin (can affect clotting)

### Activity Restrictions:
- Rest for remainder of day
- No bending, heavy lifting, exercise for 24 hours
- No smoking for minimum 5 days
- No alcohol for 24 hours
- No vigorous rinsing

### Diet:
- Soft foods for first few days
- Chew on opposite side
- Examples: pasta, mashed potato, scrambled eggs, soup
- Avoid hot foods/drinks initially
- Stay hydrated with cool water

### Complications to Watch For:

#### Bleeding:
- Some oozing normal for 24-48 hours
- If bleeding persists: bite on gauze 20 minutes
- If continues: use damp tea bag (tannins help clotting)
- Seek help if heavy bleeding continues

#### Dry Socket:
- Occurs 3-5 days post-extraction
- Increasing pain, foul taste, bad breath
- More common in smokers
- Requires dental treatment

#### Infection:
- Worsening pain/swelling after 4-6 days
- Fever, feeling unwell
- Pus discharge
- Requires urgent attention

### When to Seek Help:
- Bleeding not controlled by pressure
- Severe pain not relieved by painkillers
- Facial swelling
- Difficulty swallowing
- High temperature
- Numbness persisting after 24 hours

### Emergency Contacts:
- During hours: Contact extracting dentist
- Out of hours: NHS 111
- Severe emergency: A&E

### Special Considerations:
- Diabetics: Monitor blood sugar closely
- Blood thinners: Follow specific instructions
