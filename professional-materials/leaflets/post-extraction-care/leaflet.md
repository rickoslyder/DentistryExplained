## ü©∏ Managing Bleeding

### Normal:
- Some blood-tinged saliva for 24-48 hours
- Slight oozing from the socket

### If bleeding occurs:
1. **Sit upright** and stay calm
2. **Remove** any blood clots from your mouth
3. **Place** a clean, damp gauze pad over the socket
4. **Bite firmly** for 20 minutes - don't check it!
5. **Repeat** if necessary

### Still bleeding?
- Use a damp tea bag instead of gauze (the tannins help clotting)
- Bite for 30 minutes
- If heavy bleeding continues after 2 hours, contact us

## üíä Pain Management

### Expected:

### Pain relief:
- **Paracetamol:** Up to 1g four times daily (max 4g in 24 hours)
