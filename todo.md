## Review

### Technical Decisions:
1. **Supabase Patterns**: Fixed aggregate query issues by using separate count queries instead of nested relations
2. **Component Architecture**: Kept server/client separation clear with dedicated manager components
3. **API Design**: Consistent RESTful endpoints with proper validation using Zod schemas
4. **UI/UX**: Used shadcn/ui components consistently for professional appearance

### Key Features Implemented:
- Complete article management with CRUD operations
- Category organization with drag-and-drop reordering
- User role management with admin controls
- Analytics dashboard with visual charts
- Media library with upload capabilities
- Settings management with feature toggles

### Database Considerations:
- Used existing tables: `articles`, `categories`, `profiles`, `article_views`, `chat_sessions`
- Created media bucket in Supabase Storage
- Note: Comments system needs database schema before implementation

### Security:
- All admin endpoints check for admin/editor roles
- File uploads validated for type and size
- Proper error handling with consistent responses

### Next Steps:
1. Implement activity logs/audit trail system
2. Create settings persistence in database
3. Add comments system with moderation tools
4. Implement email templates management
5. Add more advanced analytics (conversion tracking, user journeys)

### Notes:
- Media bucket auto-creates on first access
- Settings currently use mock data (need database table)
- All features follow existing project patterns and conventions
