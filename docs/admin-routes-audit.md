| Settings | `/admin/settings` | ✅ Implemented | Admin settings |

### 2. Sub-Routes (Child Pages)
These routes are accessible through their parent routes:

#### Articles Sub-Routes
- `/admin/articles/new` - Create new article
- `/admin/articles/[id]/edit` - Edit existing article
- `/admin/articles/[id]/preview` - Preview article
- `/admin/articles/[id]/versions` - Version history

#### Email Templates Sub-Routes
- `/admin/email-templates/[template]/edit` - Edit template
- `/admin/email-templates/[template]/preview` - Preview template

### 3. Test/Development Routes
These routes appear to be for testing purposes:

| Route | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Test Editor | `/admin/test-editor` | MDX editor testing with edge cases |
| Analytics Test | `/admin/analytics/test` | GA4 real-time analytics testing |
| Analytics Test Dashboard | `/admin/analytics/test-dashboard` | Analytics dashboard testing |

## Implementation Status

### Fully Implemented Features
1. **Glossary Management** (`/admin/glossary`)
   - Term statistics and analytics
   - AI-powered term generation
   - Category and difficulty management
   - View/search/copy interaction tracking

2. **Professional Verifications** (`/admin/verifications`)
   - Complete verification workflow
   - Document review system
   - Approval/rejection with reasons
   - GDC number validation
   - Stats and filtering

3. **Article Management** (`/admin/articles`)
   - Full CRUD operations
   - MDX editor with live preview
   - Version control
   - SEO optimization
   - Category and tag management

### Routes Previously Orphaned (Now Fixed)
- **Glossary** - Was fully implemented but not in navigation ✅ FIXED
- **Verifications** - Was fully implemented but not in navigation ✅ FIXED

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions (Completed)
- ✅ Added Glossary to admin navigation
- ✅ Added Verifications to admin navigation

### 2. Future Improvements
1. **Test Routes Organization**
   - Consider moving test routes to `/admin/dev/*` namespace
   - Add feature flag to hide test routes in production
   - Or remove if no longer needed

2. **Dashboard Enhancement**
   - Complete the TODO for widget settings dialog
   - Add quick stats for Glossary and Verifications

3. **Route Documentation**
   - Add help/documentation links in admin panel
   - Create tooltips for less obvious features

4. **Access Control**
   - Verify all routes check for admin/editor permissions
   - Consider role-based feature access (e.g., only admins can verify professionals)

## Technical Notes

### Route Discovery Methods
1. **Navigation Links**: Primary method via `AdminSidebar` component
2. **Direct URL Access**: All routes accessible if URL is known
3. **Parent Route Navigation**: Sub-routes accessed through parent interfaces

### Security Considerations
- All admin routes require authentication (Clerk)
- Role checking implemented (admin/editor only)
- Supabase RLS provides additional data protection

### Missing Features
- No breadcrumb navigation for deep routes
- No admin route search/command palette
- No recent pages history

## Conclusion
The admin panel is well-implemented with two major features (Glossary and Verifications) that were previously hidden from users. These have now been added to the navigation, making all functional admin routes discoverable. The test routes should be evaluated for removal or better organization.
