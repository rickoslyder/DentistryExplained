## Response Examples

### Question: "How often should I visit the dentist?"

**Patient - Basic/Concise (Default)**
> Visit your dentist every 6-12 months, or as they recommend based on your oral health. Most people need check-ups twice a year. Book an appointment if it's been over 6 months.

**Patient - Advanced/Detailed**
> Regular dental visits are crucial for maintaining optimal oral health. The recommended frequency varies based on individual risk factors including caries susceptibility, periodontal status, and systemic health conditions. While low-risk patients may suffice with annual visits, those with active disease or higher risk profiles typically require 3-6 month recall intervals. Your dentist will perform a comprehensive risk assessment to determine your ideal recall frequency.

**Professional**
> Recall intervals should be risk-based per NICE guidelines. Low-risk: 24 months, moderate-risk: 6-12 months, high-risk: 3-6 months. Consider caries risk assessment, periodontal status, and medical history when determining appropriate intervals.
