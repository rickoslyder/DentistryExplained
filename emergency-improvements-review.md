```

4. Validate emergency countdown timers
5. Test print functionality for visual instructions
6. Verify audit logging is working correctly

## Medical Review Required
All emergency content should be reviewed by medical professionals (Curran and Vimal) before production deployment to ensure accuracy and appropriateness of guidance.
