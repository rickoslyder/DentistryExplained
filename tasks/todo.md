# GPT-Researcher Integration Todo List

## Completed Tasks âœ…

1. **Install gpt-researcher package and update dependencies** - Created Python service with FastAPI
2. **Create research API endpoint at /app/api/admin/research/route.ts** - Admin endpoint for article generation
3. **Add research functionality to article editor component** - Added "Research" button with AI draft generation
4. **Create research service with proper configuration for medical sources** - Configured trusted dental/medical sources
5. **Integrate gpt-researcher into existing web search as a provider** - Added as third search provider option
6. **Add professional research tool API and UI** - Created professional dashboard with research tool
7. **Create database schema for research jobs tracking** - Added tables for logs, jobs, and cache
8. **Add environment variables for gpt-researcher API keys** - Updated .env files with all configurations
9. **Test the integration and add error handling** - Added comprehensive error handling
10. **Create deployment documentation and Docker compose file** - Created docs and docker-compose.yml

## Review Summary

### What Was Implemented

1. **Python Research Service** (`python-research-service/`)
   - FastAPI service running GPT-Researcher
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, HuggingFace)
   - Medical source prioritization for dental content
   - Health check endpoint for monitoring

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/admin/research` - For admin article draft generation
   - `/api/professional/research` - For professional clinical research
   - Both endpoints require authentication and proper roles

3. **UI Components**
   - Enhanced article editor with "Research" button for AI drafts
   - Professional research tool at `/professional/research`
   - Download functionality for research reports

4. **Web Search Integration**
   - GPT-Researcher added as third search provider
   - Triggered by "deep research" or "comprehensive report" queries
   - Fallback to Exa on service unavailability

5. **Database Schema**
   - `professional_research_logs` - Track usage
   - `research_jobs` - For future async processing
   - `research_cache` - Cache research results
   - Updated `web_searches` to track provider

6. **Configuration**
   - Support for multiple LLM providers
   - Configurable fast/smart models
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Docker support for easy deployment

### Key Benefits

1. **Accelerated Content Creation** - Admins can generate evidence-based drafts in minutes
2. **Professional Research Tool** - Verified professionals get access to clinical research
3. **Enhanced AI Chat** - Users can request deep research on complex topics
4. **Flexible Configuration** - Easy to switch between LLM providers
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Microservice design allows independent scaling

### Security Measures

- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (admin/professional)
- Secure token for service-to-service communication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting considerations documented

### Future Enhancements

1. Implement async job processing for long research tasks
2. Add webhook notifications when research completes
3. Support custom research templates
4. Add more export formats (PDF, DOCX)
5. Implement usage quotas and billing integration

### Deployment Notes

- Python service runs on port 8000 by default
- Can be deployed with Docker or directly with Python
- Requires OpenAI and Tavily API keys minimum
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Supports horizontal scaling

The integration successfully enhances Dentistry Explained with powerful research capabilities while maintaining security and scalability.
