I have a web app idea I'd like to develop. 

Here is the business my friends and I want to create:
<BUSINESS>
  
**dentistry explained**  
**www.dentistry-explained.com**  
**1\. Summary of Wider Aims, Purpose & Intensions**

1. Produce a highly useful, widely used product that has tangible benefits to its users.The ‘Go-to’ resource for everything Dental related. The no 1\. Online dental resource online.  
1. Receive a high, recurring, long-term and labour unintensive income and cooperate/tax expense benefits.  
1. Gain professional recognition associated with the success of such a product (awards, funding, clout).  
1. Use this pedigree to propel our clinical and non-clinical careers and develop 3dent (the long term goal).  
1. Make a product and resource bank that we can personally derive significant benefit from.  
1. Contribute towards a charitable cause of our choosing on a recurrent basis.

**Current Situation**

* Currently an idea in the planning stage. Considerable research and planning has been undertaken to date to formulate a provisional plan, an idea that is \>5 years in the making. Development has been technically possible throughout, however practically challenging, labour intensive and required multiple specialist skillsets to develop. Recent advancements in AI/ML have made such prospects significantly more feasible and tangible.  
* ‘Low Hanging Fruit’. This idea is surprisingly novel, has both high user-ship/utility potential, lacks major competitors, has numerous minor and potential major competitors, is not demanding in labour/skill to develop rapidly and has high recurring revenue:low maintain potential. There is a strong sense of urgency to achieve the objectives outlines, in the timescale outline, given these vulnerabilities.  
* Development of the idea is stratified into phases with the corresponding deadlines and an executive team has been organised to achieve the above in the above timeframe.

**2\. Management Structure, Equity and Return of Capital to Stakeholders**   
	**Key Individuals / Stakeholders & Roles**

* Curran Patel Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  
* Vimal Rathod: Chief Clinical Officer (CDO)  
* William Reay: Chief of Operations Officer (COO)  
* Richard Bankole: Chief Technical Officer (CTO)

	**Sub-teams, Roles & Responsibilities, Division of Labour**  
**A: Curran & Vimal**

* Written & content development, non-written content development, marketing strategy, compliance, social media content development, referencing, planning, leadership/management, accounting.

**B: Richard & William\***

* Software development & AI, testing & maintenance, SEO & marketing strategy, non-written content development, social media content development, client/partner/user communication & liaison

\*William is to be the liaison between the teams  
	**Corporate Structure**  
	

* Not presently registered with HMRC, however we have a provisional understanding of proposed structure:  
  * 3dent Holdings (HoldCo), comprised of:  
  * Near term: Dentistry Explained (OpCo)  
  * Mid-long term: Neptune Aid (CIC)  
  * Mid-long term: 3Dent Solutions (OpCo). This name is already registered as my personal dental company however name can be transferred to our venture when ready)  
* The priority is to register the 3dent Holdings (HoldCo) and Dentistry Explained (OpCo) asap (July 1st deadline).  
* A tax efficiency investigation is required: We have received advice on exploring off-shore mechanisms for tax-efficiency however further investigations are required to confirm viable, legal, compliant, secure and feasible means. This is less important initially and more important as we become revenue and profit generating however later adoptions of the already previewed mechanism should not derive a significant opportunity cost to implementing them now. 

	**Equity & Ownership**

* The below details equity ownership split amongst stakeholders for 3dent (HoldCo).  
* The first % figure details the proposed equity share of 3dent Holdings i on initial registration of the company. The second figure details the revision of this pending the success of Dentistry Explained:  
  * Curran Patel 70% \- 51%  
  * Vimal Rathod 10% \- 16.33%  
  * William Reay 10% \- 16.33%  
  * Richard Bankole 10% \- 16.33%

Example: 3 year valuation assumption 3dent Holdings (Holdco): £1,000,000  
Equity value amongst stakeholders:

* Curran: £700,000  
* Vimal: £100,000  
* William: £100,000  
* Richard £100,000

Example 5-7 year valuation assumption 3dent Holdings (Holdco): £2,000,000  
Equity value amongst stakeholders:

* Curran: £1,020,000  
* Vimal: £326,000  
* William: £326,000  
* Richard £326,000  
* On the successful development of 3dent Solutions (OpCo) & Neptune Aid (CIC), equity is to be reallocated for Dentistry Explained & Neptune Aid to give stakeholders an effectively equal equity ownership in both Dentistry Explained and Neptune Aid, however the equity split amongst stakeholders of 3dent Holdings (HoldCo) is to be maintained:  
* 3dent Holdings (Holdco)  
  * Curran Patel 70%  
  * Vimal Rathod 10%  
  * William Reay 10%   
  * Richard Bankole 10%  
* Dentistry Explained (OpCo), Neptune Aid (CIC)  
  * Curran Patel 26%   
  * Vimal Rathod 24.67%  
  * William Reay 24.67%  
  * Richard Bankole 24.67%

Example 7-10 year valuation assumption 3dent Holdings (Holdco): £6,000,000  
Equity value amongst stakeholders:

* Curran: £4,200,000  
* Vimal: £600,000  
* William: £600,000  
* Richard £600,000

	**Revenue, Profit Allocation, Remuneration** 

* Initially, draw out minimal profit and instead tactically re-invest profit into further development/expansion & marketing of the existing product (Dentistry Explained) and eventually development of future ventures and products (e.g. Neptune Aid & 3Dent Solutions).  
* Initially, we want to maximise the amount of revenue/profit generated to return into specially marketing to grow our user base, viewership, reputation & standing. After this is secured, we want to re-invest profit into exploration of commercial opportunities within Dentistry explained. Once Dentistry Explained is asserted in the market and is achieving a consistent, recurring and low-maintenance revenue stream whilst maintaining a high profit margin, we allocate the majority of profit (after allocation to a growing recurring marketing spend) to development of 3dent solutions and a nominal recurring amount to a charitable cause via a registered and self owned charity (CIC).  
* On achievement of a satisfactory, stable, consistent and recurring profit that is low maintenance from Dentistry Explained, a standardised base remuneration amongst stakeholders: Profit after deductions (operating costs/expenses/development/maintenance/marketing/compliance etc.) is to be distributed equally amongst stakeholders as a standardised % figure of the stakeholders equity share and to be returned to stakeholders on a periodic basis (monthly/quarterly/yearly).  
* Stakeholders to receive performance bonus based on the achievement of profit targets, awards & other KPI's. This is separate and in addition to the income derived from equity return.  
* With the phased reallocation of equity ownership and performance bonuses, contingent on success in completion of Dentistry Explained and later 3dent Solutions, the strategy outlined gives the opportunity for non CEO (Curran) stakeholders to return a progressively growing return of equity.

Example 7-10 year valuation assumption 3dent Holdings (HoldCo): £6,000,000  
Equity value amongst stakeholders:

* Curran: £4,200,000  
* Vimal: £600,000  
* William: £600,000  
* Richard £600,000

Assuming at this stage, annualised profits after deductions from Dentistry Explained (OpCo) and Neptune Aid (CIC) available for return to stakeholders is £2,000,000, stakeholders are able to receive the following annualised return of equity as income separate and in addition to any performance bonuses from Dentistry Explained/Neptune Aid alone:

* Curran Patel 26% \= £520,000/year  
* Vimal Rathod 24.67% \= £493,400/year  
* William Reay  24.67% \= £493,400/year  
* Richard Bankole 24.67% \= £493,400/year  
* With implementation of an effective domestic and off-shore tax efficient structure, the aim is to retain as much of this as possible come this stage.

**3\. Final Product (FP) Summary**  
	**Problems/Needs**

* Everybody has a mouth (oral cavity). A healthy mouth is vital for normal function, bodily/medical health for everyone and cosmetically for an ever increasing majority of the populous. Dentistry is a specialised field pertaining to the management and care of the oral cavity. Poor dental health leads to pain, dysfunction, medical/bodily complications, reduced quality of life and can entail significant financial, psychological, emotional/mental health, and functional detriment on an individual to population scale.  
* Dentistry as a profession is often regarded as being highly opaque to the general public. The general public have a largely unsatisfactory understanding Dentistry as a whole including a basic understanding of dental disease, treatments, prevention/maintenance, dietary & medical implications and the sub-specialities & training commitments involved in being a dental clinical professional. In addition to this and enforced by this opacity, Dentistry has a poor standing amongst the general public who hold the profession and dental clinicians in low esteem, with distrust and are frequently antagonistically targeted in media.  
* The majority of the general public that are in receipt of dental care provisions do so via the NHS or on a private basis, upsold via the NHS. The NHS has fundamentally and systemically degraded the value, standards, operational effectiveness of Dental service provisions and compromised the fields ethical obligations to patients. The system is distorted to the extent that it does not provide a service that is in the best interest of the patient, or clinician. As such, there is an epidemic of poor access to dental health services, failure of the adequate provision of basic/fundamental and routine dental education/preventative/maintenance practices, failure to appropriately  of assess/review/treat patients, materials limitation with adjunctive issues such as poor attendance/high FTA rates, eroded appreciation/value for service provisions.   
* The general public are mostly unaware of the symbiotic relationship between dental health and bodily/medical/metal health/wellbeing.   
* Patient led and modifiable lifestyle decisions and behaviours persist in contributing/causing a significant amount of dental and medical ailments which are entirely preventable.   
* The vast majority of patients do not have a flying fuck what is going on (their findings, diagnosis, prognosis, need for/relevance of recalls/x-rays/assessments, treatments available and theirs risks/benefits, phasing of treatment, need for specialist intervention where required, understanding of specialisms, risks & benefits, materials and required maintenance/prevention measures). In effect, the majority of patients are not being appropriately consented for dental services which is a mandatory legal requirement. This is not aided by barriers to population based factors that are barriers to communication such as the  significant proportion low-mid IQ patients that exist in the population, the significant and growing proportion of the neurodivergent patient base, limited resources for non-english speakers and those with speech/language/cognitive disabilities. Such individuals (of which, there are many) that have difficulty processing, memorising, reasoning and recalling information based in a purely written or verbal format which most Dental information is presented in. This situation is severely exacerbated buy the NHS led compression of service provision capabilities with diminishing actual budget, increased population need vs less service providers available, increased costs of service provisions and driven down prices to patients, that synergistically have caused created highly time pressured appointment/booking systems, in which effective communication is simply not feasible.  
* The UK is the most litigious country in the world for dental related claims, and the rates of claims & successful claims is increasing more than in any nation. The UK Dental regulatory body (GDC) is amongst the/if not the most aggressive and credibly unjust (and in many instances, unlawful) in the world. UK Dentists have amongst the weakest and most incapable/ineffective representative union (BDA) in the country. Dental Care Professionals are experiences significant and growing stress (emotional & physical) in return of a lower income, lesser ability to provide optimal treatment (more time pressure & increased costs of providing services) and less incentive to provide services, increased patient dissatisfaction/complaints/litigations/GDC investigations, clinician suicides, de-registration and resignations (further exacerbating the overall situation via a means of positive feedback).  
* There is no UK or global industry standard / go-to resource for Dentistry information. Resources available presently are highly fragmented, have variable quality/accuracy/trustworthiness & have variable accessibility.

**Risks & Mitigation** 

* Identifiable risks and mitigation/management, not in orders of risk or priority

**1\. AI Hallucination**  
Risks

* Generative AI information risk whereby incorrect, misleading, or fabricated information is produced by a LLM and can even be presented as factual or plausible. AI Hallucinations can present in several ways in our platform. Firstly directly in the LLM AI GPT that enables conversational style user. Secondly, indirectly from the team utilising AI tools/software to find/reference/cite/organise/summarise research and information that has in in turn been compromised by AI hallucination. 

Mitigation

* Meticulous human review/moderation of ‘Primary Source Backend Content’.   
* Domain limited GPT/LLM: AI chat bot designed to only utilise content housed on Dentistry Explained. Failure to give a satisfactory response after this is only provided with a clear disclaimer that extra-domain information has been used in to formulate a response, and the user is liable for referencing this themselves and any consequences in adhering to this/not adhering to this. 

**2\. GDPR/DPIA Compliance Breach**  
Risks

* Highly sensitive, legally protected and high risk of litigation data is compromised by inadequate GDPR/DPIA & compliance measures, safeguards, firewalls and protection.  
* This can result from defects in a system in which we have built and are operating that produce the breach endogenously.   
* This can also result in a exogenous threat and breach (cyber/hack). 

Mitigation

* GDPR/DPIA framework of protection, compliance and audit.  
* Solicitor / Legal in-house council to guide the development and maintenance of the above framework.  
* Protection via the means of a professional cyber security firm.   
* To consider an insurance policy to insure against such a breach which is an ever more likely risk. 

**3\. Content Credibility**   
Risks

* The publication and propagation of information that is false, has an insufficient evidence base to support, AI hallucination derived, derives from a bias source or is partially factual. This represents a credibly and trustworthiness risk 

Mitigation

* Meticulous human review/moderation of ‘Primary Source Backend Content’.  
* Appropriate planning and organisation of 'Primary Source Backend Content’, assessment and stratification of evidence base in regards to its quality, citations/references and other key metrics relevant of any high quality information source (e.g. Guidelines: NICE, SDEP, Cochrane. Guidance: NHS trust guidance. Private Postgraduate Courses: Aspire, ACE, MV).

**4\. Market Adoption Lag**  
Risks

* Delayed, protracted development and ineffective launch, propagation and dissemination campaigns leading to poor uptake and growth, poor market penetration and therefore little real benefits to users on a wider scale.

Mitigation

* Hard launch, with a meticulous phased plan with a complete and planned strategy in place to initially attract attention, assert dominance/reputation/standing/credibility, return real benefit to users, allow organic growth.   
* Phase 1 Launch : Application of a multi faceted launch strategy that fully leverages Dentistry.co.uk, key individuals/organisations with an effective media marketing & SEO strategy, planned to be implemented in unison build momentum.  
* Phase 2 Launch: Increase Social Media marketing, continue to leverage key individuals/organisations, apply and gain recognition for awards/funding. Entice professional users with ‘for free for a limited time only’ access.   
* Phase 3 Launch: Have an asserted place in the market and significantly expand marketing operations via all channels, win/have won multiple awards/received recognition  
* Prior to Phase 1, ensure that Dentistry Explained is protected via a means of purchasing potential/high risk/likely competitor domains, similar domains, HRMC registration & trademarking.  
* Ensure that the product is THE gold standard and best version of itself on the market and an effective product that derived tangible use to users, it is in itself asserting and protecting its market position, reinforced and propagated by and effective marketing strategy and basic IP strategy.

**5\. Outcompeted by Competitor & IP Breach**  
Risks

* As a ‘low hanging fruit’ product, multiple competitors (direct/indirect) are able to produce a similar or equivalent product with their infrastructure, human resources, funding, market dominance etc

Mitigation

* This operation is highly fucking classified and on a need to know basis. 4 people need to know and that is it.   
*   
* Prior to Phase 1, ensure that Dentistry Explained is protected via a means of purchasing potential/high risk/likely competitor domains, similar domains, HRMC registration & trademarking.  
*   
* Ensure that the product is THE gold standard and best version of itself on the market and an effective product that derived tangible use to users, it is in itself asserting and protecting its market position, reinforced and propagated by and effective marketing strategy and basic IP strategy.  
* Ensure that we have a meticulously planned and phased launch/marketing strategy and dominant commercial viable product ready for a hard launch to generate new momentum and capitalise on this aggressively. This has to be fully in place and strategised prior to the launch.

**Finding Dentist Users**

* [Dentistry.co.uk](http://dentistry.co.uk/) article \+ social media posts to market to dentists, gain standing and identity. Secondary benefit is to start relationship with them to win award recognition for 2026 industry awards. This is more of a buckshot/spray type strategy where they market our product and we then rely on viewership of their content to funnel to our product. This is more important for standing/identity but less effective and reliable in gaining actual users (dentist and patient users). To smash this we also need a more targeted approach to be applied at the same time:

**Finding Dentist & Patient Users**
